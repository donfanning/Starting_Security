# Starting Security

This repo contains a PDF of the slide deck presented by Chris Sandulow ([<img src="https://github.com/favicon.ico" width="15">](https://github.com/jfalken)) and Andreas Nilsson ([<img src="https://github.com/favicon.ico" width="15">](https://github.com/agralius)) at [BSides NOLA 2015](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/91550808/BSidesNOLA%202015).

## Details

The slides are intended to be used in combination with a spoken presentation. While it is possible to follow along with just the deck, more content is needed.

A written companion to the slides will be added to this repo.

## Future Work

The content of this slide deck will be expanded upon and we will be releasing an Open Source 'Book', describing our thoughts on this topic in more depth. Since its open source, we hope others will collaborate and assist us in improving the content.

The end goal is to help small and/or new companies with establishing a security program as early as possible and what to look for in their first security hire(s).
